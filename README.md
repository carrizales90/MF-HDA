# MF-HDA
Python code for Multifractal Higuchi Dimension Analysis

We share two codes: "MF-HDA.py" and "Rescaled_CIL.py". These are described in our paper: "Generalization of Higuchiâ€™s fractal dimension for multifractal analysis of short time series". Also we share a file "First_10K_integrated_Ulysses_Book.dat" which is a segment of one of the books reported in our publication. Finally, the folders "MFH_P_15-100_Ulysses_ki25_kf0_Nbins16" and "Rescaled_CIL_Ulysses" are created by our codes and results are into them.

In order to use these codes, you will requiere the python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, and seaborn.

For installing you can do it via the command line by entering:

python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn

or 

sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas python-seaborn

any question you can contact us via email to c.carrizales.v@gmail.com

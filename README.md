# MF-HDA
###### Python code for Multifractal Higuchi Dimension Analysis

We share two files: **MF-HDA.py** and **Rescaled_CIL.py**. These are described in our paper: *"Generalization of Higuchiâ€™s fractal dimension for multifractal analysis of short time series"*. We also share the file **First_10K_integrated_Ulysses_Book.dat** which is a book's fragment mentioned in our publication. Finally, the folders ***MFH_P_15-100_Ulysses_ki25_kf0_Nbins16*** and ***Rescaled_CIL_Ulysses*** are created by our scripts and contain their appropiate results.

In order to use these scripts, you will require the python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, and seaborn.

To install via command line (CLI):

`python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn`

or 

`sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas python-seaborn`
